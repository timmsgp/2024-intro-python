Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n","\n","Compared with other programming languages, Pythonâ€™s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation."],"metadata":{"id":"08aa4b0c"},"id":"08aa4b0c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Making an object"],"metadata":{"id":"d773f17d-fdc1-40d2-9fc1-82fddffcf346"},"id":"d773f17d-fdc1-40d2-9fc1-82fddffcf346"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We have been working with Python classes for a long time, we just might not have known it!"],"metadata":{"id":"3a7329fa"},"id":"3a7329fa"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["TestInt = 5\n","print(type(TestInt))  # TestInt is a class integer"],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"aa4d1b6d","outputId":"61b9a0fc-535f-4a2e-a960-5dfa987a6b46"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"<class 'int'>\n"}],"id":"aa4d1b6d"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(f'The value of 2 + 3 is {2 + 3}')  # how does the language know how to add two integers together?\n","print(int.__add__(2,3))"],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"8e175c97","outputId":"08c604ef-7c33-4d2f-c7b0-61c74597b81c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"The value of 2 + 3 is 5\n5\n"}],"id":"8e175c97"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import inspect\n","print(inspect.getmembers(TestInt))"],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"10384075","outputId":"3b2e688d-f353-47e8-d331-f453710b6b33"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"[('__abs__', <method-wrapper '__abs__' of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__add__', <method-wrapper '__add__' of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__and__', <method-wrapper '__and__' of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__bool__', <method-wrapper '__bool__' of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__ceil__', <built-in method __ceil__ of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__class__', <class 'int'>), ('__delattr__', <method-wrapper '__delattr__' of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__dir__', <built-in method __dir__ of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__divmod__', <method-wrapper '__divmod__' of int object at 0x7f9d10658170>), ('__doc__', \"int([x]) -> integer\\nint(x, base=10) -> integer\\n\\nConvert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments\\nare given.
